# ### Steps to execute the reading of a screenshot
# 1. Import the required libraries
# 2. Read the image using cv2
# 3. Use function preprocessing() to convert the image to grayscale and add a threshold
# 4. Before using the read_photo() function and pass the image as a parameter. (make sure to change the path to the tesseract.exe file). This will get all the text from the image.
# 5. Lastly, to get the desired test use the get_lines_needed() function and pass the text as a parameter. This will return a list of strings, contains the important information from the image.

    # This converts the image to grayscale

    t, thresh = cv2.threshold(gray, 0, 255, cv2.ADAPTIVE_THRESH_GAUSSIAN_C | cv2.THRESH_OTSU)  # Add threshold
    # invert the threshold
    thresh = cv2.bitwise_not(thresh)

    kernel = np.ones((1, 1), np.int8)
    # dilate the image
